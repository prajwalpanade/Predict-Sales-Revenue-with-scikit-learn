# Predict-Sales-Revenue-with-scikit-learn
worked with simple linear regession in coursera project network

 long project-based course, you will build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using Python. You will employ the scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting. You will be working with the very popular Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper.
